This game of checkers is selfmade and thought to be fully playable on terminal.
It also has 3 playable modes:
- 1p ('One player') : Let's a single player play aganist the computer
- 2p ('Two players') : Play with a friend! It allows 2 humans to play against each other.
- bot : It fully uses the semi-randominc logic to auto-play, to let the computer have a full game by itself.

Have fun :)
